# knapsack-qaoa
Code for my bachelor thesis on QAOA for the Knapsack Problem.

In this code I implement three approaches to QAOA for the knapsack problem:
1. Soft constraints using quadratic penalty (a QUBO approach)
2. Soft constraints using linear penalty (by using a feasibility oracle)
3. Hard constraints using a quantum walk mixer

Feel free to write me a mail if you have any questions or would like to use the code for your own projects (rholst@mailbox.org). I would be glad to help.
